        What I Believe
    </mat-card-title>

    <mat-card-content>
        I believe movement is life
        <br/> I believe you can heal your body with a return to simple functional movement patterns
        <br/> I believe it is never too late to create change in a body and it can happen faster than you ever thought possible.
        <br/> I believe your body know what it needs
        <br/> I believe every system in your body relies on a functional musculoskeletal system. The musculoskeletal system is the body system that provides the framework for movement and stability.
        <br/>
        <br/> All systems in the body work on movement:
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>the heart beats</li>
            <li>the lungs breathe</li>
            <li>the stomach grinds</li>
            <li>the colon transports</li>
            <li>the blood flows</li>
            <li>the nerves conduct</li>
            <li>the muscles contract</li>

        </ul>
        <br/> Pain in the body begins when movement patterns are impaired. Restore your bodies proper design for movement and the pain will cease. No fancy machinery or pills required; your body already has everything it needs to heal.
        <br/>
        <br/> I believe you need to trust yourself; you have the ability to help yourself.
        <br/> I believe you need to take responsibility for your present state of health.
        <br/> I believe with your commitment to change, you can become free of pain.
        <br/> I believe your age does not limit you from feeling good again.
        <br/> It is never too late to begin. <b>Let's get started.</b><br/>
