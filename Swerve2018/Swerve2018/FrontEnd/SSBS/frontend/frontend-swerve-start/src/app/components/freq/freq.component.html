        The ability for you to stand in front of your webcam for posture analysis will be important. It is best if you are wearing shorts and a tank top so that your legs are visible above the knees and your shoulders and arms are visible. You are in your bare
        feet. You may choose to upload 4 posture photos prior to the appointment, as this will expedite the assessment process.

        At evaluation we will discuss your symptoms and your general health history I may ask you to perform several movements during your assessment, so having the space in front of your webcam for you to stand, sit or lie on the floor would be excellent.<br/>
        <br/> After the initial evaluation, I will recommend a specific sequence of movements or exercises. This sequence is called a menu. This menu is designed to relieve your symptoms and improve your overall joint alignment and body balance. It is
        designed to be performed daily for maximum results. This initial online consultation will be approximately 60-90 minutes.
